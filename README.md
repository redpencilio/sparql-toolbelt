# sparql-toolbelt

Currently simply a toolkit to make debugging data-issues a little less painful, and somewhat reusable. 
No though went into its design and no documentation is available. Use at your own risk!

# Tooling

This project was made and built with node v16.x and npm v8.x. This means the package-lock has the v2 format. 
If you use volta, it will automatically pick this up thanks to the config key in the package.json.

# Usage

`npm run start` should give you usage instructions for the cli.
